# Flexbox training
This project is part of my individual development plan, focused on improving my knowledge in **flexbox**.

### **In this repository I made a simple HTML page to test all the properties described in the [CSS-TRICKS documentation](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)**

### To run this project, do the following steps:
1. Clone this repository in your local directory;
2. If you use VS Code, right-click the index.js file and then click "Open with Live Server";
3. Now you can play around in style.css file with different flexbox properties.
